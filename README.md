# NSDate-Extensions
This collection was inspired by Erica Sadun's Objective-C Date Extensions (https://github.com/erica/NSDate-Extensions).  

I started off just porting those functions over to Swift.  After building a few apps, I noticed part of my new project set-up was to always add this extension, so hopefully it can be useful to others!
