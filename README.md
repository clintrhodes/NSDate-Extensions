# NSDate-Extensions
This collection was inspired by Erica Sadun's Objectivce-C Date Extensions (https://github.com/erica/NSDate-Extensions).  

I started off just porting those funcitons over to Swift.  After building a few apps, I noticed part of my new project set-up was to always bring this extension into-play and it kept getting updated, so I figured I might as well throw it up on github.
