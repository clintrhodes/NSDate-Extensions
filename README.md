# NSDate-Extensions
This collection was inspired by Erica Sadun's Objective-C Date Extensions (https://github.com/erica/NSDate-Extensions).  

I started off just porting those funcitons over to Swift.  After building a few apps, I noticed part of my new project set-up was to always add this extension.  I would always wind up add another method here or there until it reached it's current state.  

Hopefully it can be useful to others!
